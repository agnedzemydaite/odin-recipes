    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour</b>: This cranberry pie starts with a cup of all-purpose flour.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar</b>: A cup of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li><b>Salt</b>: You might not think a pinch of salt would make much of a difference, but you'll miss it if you don't use it.</li>
        <li><b>Cranberries</b>: Buy whole berries that are plump, firm, and unblemished. You can substitute frozen cranberries for fresh, but it will change the consistency of the batter, making it thicker.</li>
        <li><b>Nuts</b>: This recipe calls for walnuts, but you can pecans if you'd rather.</li>
        <li><b>Eggs</b>: Whole eggs add moisture and bind the batter together.</li>
        <li><b>Almond extract</b>: Almond extract lends a subtly complex and nutty flavor. You can substitute vanilla extract if you'd like.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the apples in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the apples with white sugar, flour, and cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Drizzle water over the apples.</li>
        <li>Make the oat topping, then sprinkle it over the apples.</li>

    </ol>
